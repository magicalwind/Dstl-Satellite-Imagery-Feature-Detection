# Dstl-Satellite-Imagery-Feature-Detection
Train batch CNNï¼Œ u-net and XGB model to classify and auto-label the objects from 3 bands satellite image. Try pixel based and polygon (segmentation) based algorithm with shapely and openCV. Train batch CNN to deal with larger datasets with 16 bands satellite image.
